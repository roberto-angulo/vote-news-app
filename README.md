## Hi !

Hello, I want to say thank you for considering me for this vacant.

## Setup

1.0 First of all, please install packages by using yarn install.

2.0 Then use yarn start

3.0 You can go to the app by writting in your browser bar as follows: localhost:[number-of-the-port]/main

# About the code

This project was built on top of create-react-app, so you have to run the app with yarn start. All the code is in the src folder. I also did unit tests to the VoteCard component, which is located on src > voteComponents > VoteCard, there’s the file with the tests. The idea is to have each component as a small self-containing part of the app, so I created a folder for each of those, with the .jsx and sass file. The approach that I followed to store the user votes, it’s to store it, in browser local storage.

Thank you, regards.
