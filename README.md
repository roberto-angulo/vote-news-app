## Hi !

Hello, I want to say thank you for considering me for this vacant.

# About the code

This project was built on top of create-react-app, so you have to run the app with yarn start. All the code is in the src folder. I also did unit tests to the VoteCard component, which is located on src > voteComponents > VoteCard, there’s the file with the tests. The idea is to have each component as a small self-containing part of the app, so I created a folder for each of those, with the .jsx and sass file. The approach that I followed to store the user votes, it’s to store it, in browser local storage.

Thank you, regards.
